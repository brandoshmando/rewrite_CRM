CRM Rewrite
===========
This is a rewrite of an assignment I had while I was at [Bitmaker Labs]('http://bitmakerlabs.com'). The [original version](https://github.com/brandoshmando/CRM) was my attempt at OOP and didn't come out the way that I had hoped. This version is much cleaner and way DRY'er. The CRM is a command line to for managing contacts.
